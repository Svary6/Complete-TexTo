# Complete-TexTo
A modified script, originally made by the youtuber Acrylic, made to be able to automatically detect your voice, and transform it into Kasane Teto with the help of OpenUtau-TexTo. Modified to have no need for a focused window or a second PC, without any pyautogui tomfoolery. All automatic without being bothersome to use. Hopefully.

To use this, you NEED OpenUtau-TexTo, downloadable at https://github.com/Svary6/OpenUtau-TexTo/tree/main along with the Teto voicebank included. Make sure to read everything there. Also, python is required so make sure you have it installed, as the program uses an amalgamation of python packages to even run.

The usage is quite simple:

1. Download and extract OpenUtau-TexTo anywhere (except program files, i believe that causes problems)

2. Dowload and extract Complete TexTo

3. Launch the .bat file

4. After a little bit of waiting, a file explorer window will open, select the directory where openutau.exe is and select it. (make sure it is 100% the modded version)

5. Then the command prompt will prompt you (haha) to wait until you are prompted to speak.

6. "Listening" means that you may talk. Try to talk at a normal pitch and not super fast. A headphone icon will show this in the top left.

7. After a slight bit of not speaking, the program will process your voice, open OpenUtau-TexTo if not already open, and start playing the file. This is signified by a microphone icon in the top left.

8. Repeat steps 5-7.

If the file selection doesn't work, open openutau_path.txt and copy the file directory into the notepad there. Make sure to include .../openutau.exe

Note that the program is a bit unstable and is being held together by bolt and duct tape. It might not work if you already have OpenUtau installed, so make sure to remove it beforehand if it causes trouble. But theoretically it shouldn't be a problem if you set your OpenUtau-TexTo directory correctly.

That should be all for now. Happy Teto-ing!
