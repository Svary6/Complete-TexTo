# Complete-TexTo
A modified script, originally made by the youtuber Acrylic, made to be able to automatically detect your voice, and transform it into Kasane Teto with the help of OpenUtau-TexTo. Modified to have no need for a focused window or a second PC, without any pyautogui tomfoolery. All automatic without being bothersome to use. Hopefully.
